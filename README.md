# Burrows-Wheeler-Transform
This repository contains the burrow-wheelr's transform algorithm along with its implementation in c,c++,python.

#INTRODUCTION
The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a data transformation algorithm that restructures data in such a way that the transformed message is more compressible. This algorithm is generally used in conjunction with the Move-to-Front (MTF) algorithm, Run length encoding(RLE) and the Huffman coding.

#REAL-LIFE APPLICATIONS
1.File Compression
2 DNA Referencing
